My name is Jenny Blass, and I’m an undergraduate at the University of Michigan.

I'm currently completing a double majoring in Linguistics and Computer Science, and I’m interested in the intersection of these fields, particularly computational linguistics, natural language processing, and AI and data science more broadly. I’m excited to explore ways computational techniques can deepen our understanding of human language processing, and to continue growing as a researcher.
