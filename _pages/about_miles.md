My name is Miles Gilberti, and I am an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. I am studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science, with particular interest in computational psycholinguistics. I enjoy thinking about how neural systems can accomplish syntactic and semantic computation tasks. I'm currently working on projects in emergent communication and LLM interpretability. As I begin my research career, I hope to help develop more specific and detailed computational accounts of the ways neural networks achieve complex linguistic behavior.
