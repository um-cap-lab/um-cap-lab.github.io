We are a lab in the  Department of Linguistics at the University of Michigan, dedicated to advancing research on computational models of language acquisition and processing.

The lab benefits from access to extensive research infrastructure, including [advanced research computing](https://its.umich.edu/advanced-research-computing) resources such as GPU hours on the Great Lakes HPC. Additionally, we provide members with powerful machines to support their lab work. 

New members can request access to details about the lab resources and current plans [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DVECiQFOCqaM4XC2l4ND0Ynx-DVYm2RxxN-EhL_yQus/edit?usp=sharing).

In the coming years, we will be recruiting passionate and talented undergraduate and graduate research assistants, as well as postdoctoral researchers, who work on the intersection of computational modeling, language acquisition, and theoretical phonology. Hiring details will be posted hereâ€”stay tuned!
