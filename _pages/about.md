We are a lab in the  Department of Linguistics at the University of Michigan, dedicated to advancing research on computational models of language acquisition and processing.

In the coming years, we will be recruiting undergrad and graduate research assistant, and postdoctoral researchers specializing in the intersection of computational modeling, language acquisition, and theoretical phonology. Stay tuned!
