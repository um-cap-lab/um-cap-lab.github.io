My name is Huteng Dai (xu˨˩tʰəŋ˧˥ tai˥˨ 戴虎腾; [meaning](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/281826889168185122/)). I am an assistant professor of computational linguistics and phonology at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics). 

My research focuses on understanding how humans learn sound patterns from noisy, real-world data. I build interpretable models of phonological learning that are not only mathematically well-defined but also succeed on real-world corpora.
