My name is Huteng Dai (xu˨˩tʰəŋ˧˥ tai˥˨ 戴虎腾; meaning). I am an assistant professor of computational linguistics and phonology at the University of Michigan. 

My research focuses on understanding how humans learn sound patterns from noisy, real-world data. I build interpretable models of phonological learning that are not only mathematically well-defined but also succeed on real-world corpora.
