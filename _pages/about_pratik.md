My name is Pratik Patil, an Aerospace Systems Engineer from the Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering at the University of Michigan, specializing in cross-domain modeling and computational mathematics.

I’m experienced in developing high-performance simulations for complex aerospace, multiphysics simulation, and NLP challenges.

I’m particularly interested in building sentiment analysis models tailored to the unique context of space missions, potentially integrating data from wearable sensors for a multi-modal approach.
