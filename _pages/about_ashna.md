My name is Ashna Mulchandani (ɑʃnə). I am an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, graduating in May of 2025.

I study Linguistics, Computer Science, and French, and am pursuing topics in natural language processing and computational linguistics. I am particularly interested in the intersection of language and technology, as well as its potential for new artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.
