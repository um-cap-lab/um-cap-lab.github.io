My name is Ashna (ɑʃnə) Mulchandani. I was an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, graduating in May of 2025. I studied Linguistics, Computer Science, and French, and pursued topics in natural language processing and computational linguistics. I was particularly interested in the intersection of language and technology, as well as its potential for new artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.
